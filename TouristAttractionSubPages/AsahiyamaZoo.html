		<p>The Asahiyama Zoo is a municipal zoo opened in July 1967 in Asahikawa, Hokkaidō, Japan, and is the northernmost zoo in the country,where the annual temperature gap reaches almost 70°C.
			 At Asahiyama Zoo, you’ll meet about 150 kinds of animals that can survive in this challenging environment. In addition to Arctic creatures such as polar bears and penguins, the zoo
			 houses other species including capybaras, atelids (monkeys),deer, eagles, cranes and (now extinct) wolves, as well as various animals from across the world, such as polar bears,
			 apes, big cats and giraffes. and orangutans normally found in jungles.Its popularity lies in the enclosures which allow visitors to observe the animals from various angles, many of 
			 which are unique to Asahiyama Zoo.</p>
