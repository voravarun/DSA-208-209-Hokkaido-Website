		<h1 id="description">Description </h1>
		<p>Matsumae Castle is a castle located in Matsumae in Hokkaidō, Japan, and is the northernmost castle in Japan. The only traditional style Edo period castle in Hokkaidō,
		it was the chief residence of the han of the Matsumae clan of feudal lords from the 17th to 19th centuries.In 1854, the castle was expanded and renamed Matsumae Castle.
		It had three towers, 15 gates, and a 25-cannon armory. Walking through the grounds of Matsumae Castle feels like stepping into another world. The scent of salt water and 
		seasonal flowers mingle in the air.With around 10,000 trees and 250 different varieties of cherry blossoms, Matsumae Park is an amazing place in spring. Thanks to the 
		many varieties of cherry blossoms in the park, Matsumae has a longer-than-usual blooming season, with the delicate pink and white blossoms appearing from late April through late May.
		During this time, Matsumae Castle hosts a cherry blossom festival complete with delicious festival foods.</p>
