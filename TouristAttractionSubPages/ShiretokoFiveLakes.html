		<h4>Five lakes, formed by the fingertips of a god!</h4>
		<p>The Shiretoko Five Lakes is located in the town of Shari in Hokkaido. Legend has it that the Shiretoko Five Lakes were formed when a god dug their fingertips into
			the ground of the UNESCO World Heritage Shiretoko Peninsula,a region blessed with idyllic natural beauty. But scientifically speaking, a set of five small lakes  are 
			formed long ago by the eruption of nearby Mount Io and fed by underground springs. Each year Hokkaido sees the autumn colors before anywhere else in Japan, and if you visit the Shiretoko Five Lakes
			from around late September to mid-October, you can expect to find yourself surrounded by the rich reds and yellows, and gold colors of autumnal foliage, 
			undisturbed by human hands. Venture out across the elevated wooden walkways and forest trails for stunning views of the vivid autumnal scenery reflected in the
			mirror-like surfaces of the lakes. If you’re lucky, you may even catch a glimpse of some of the local wildlife, such as squirrels and deer!</p>
