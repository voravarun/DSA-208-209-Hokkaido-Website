		<p>Bandit's Stew is our most popular dish - so popular that people cannot resist ordering it even in the hot summer. It contains Ezo venison, duck, and chicken meat along with local fresh vegetables for a rustic, frontier taste. This restaurant was among the first to introduce Ezo venison cuisine to Furano 34 years ago. Ezo venison is savory and goes down easy. If you come at a good time, you can even enjoy delicious raw deer organ meat. Many customers from across the country come to the restaurant, so they do the best to reach out and offer Furano travel advice. They may even tell you a secret back-story behind a certain famous TV drama. Their special Japanese-style private rooms are in the back. They hang pots with grape vines taken from the drama's filming location. You can enjoy your meal in horigotatsu (sunken heated table) seats.</p>

        <p>For the "Eel Nigiri," the chef use the tasty eel with fat from Miyagi. Because he boils it after grilling it perfectly, it comes out fluffy and tender. He makes his own sauce, which is added to the original sauce created when the restaurant opened. It is slightly sweet and goes well with eel. Liver of monkfish, which is local from Otaru, is soaked in salt water for half a day. Following that, I carefully remove the blood and other excess parts, and then steam it. Please enjoy it dipped in homemade ponzu sauce with seaweed, ginger, grated radish with chili, or kabosu (citrus fruit). He makes an effort to converse with the customers when he has time to pay attention to the surroundings after the busiest time passes.

		<p>Although the Genghis Khan (grilled mutton) served in the all-you-can-eat-and-drink course is delicious, they also have an array of superb single dishes. They highly recommend the lamb shoulder roast in particular, with its delicious balance between meat and fat. They also recommend that you try the sangenton samgyeopsal, which has a fine balance between the pork’s sweetness and umami (pleasant savory taste), and the umami of the vegetables. When it comes to ingredients, they use Shiraoi beef, Nakasatsunai chicken, and Sangenton pork from Date. Their customers’ opinions are extremely important to us. Therefore, they strive to provide good service, not only in the kitchen, but in the dining hall too, where he listen to feedback from customers and give explanations on the ingredients and how to best eat them. The restaurant can accommodate a wide variety of functions, including dinner parties, business receptions, and family outings. They have a variety of rooms available to choose from, including a dynamic beer hall, stylish semi-private rooms, and charming private Japanese-style rooms.</p>
